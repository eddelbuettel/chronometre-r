Description: As a 'chronomètre' is a 'stopwatch', this package offers a simple stopwatch, and
 in particular one that can be shared with Python (using the corresponding package of the same
 name available via 'PyPi') such that both interpreters operate on the same object instance and
 shown in the demo file, as well as in the unit tests.
